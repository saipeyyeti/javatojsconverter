To convert the Java `Order` class to Node.js/JavaScript, we'll create two files: one for the `Order` class itself and another for a simple validation utility, adhering to the "Collection of utility functions framework" requirement.

---

### File 1: `utils/validation.js`

This file provides a reusable utility function for validating objects, fulfilling the "Collection of utility functions framework" requirement.

```javascript
/**
 * @file Utility functions for common validation checks.
 * @module utils/validation
 */

/**
 * Checks if a given value is a non-null, non-undefined object.
 * This function is synchronous and does not use async/await as it performs a simple check.
 *
 * @param {*} value - The value to check.
 * @param {string} [name='Value'] - The name of the value, used in error messages for better context.
 * @throws {Error} If the value is not a valid object (i.e., null, undefined, or not of type 'object').
 */
function validateObject(value, name = 'Value') {
    if (!value || typeof value !== 'object') {
        throw new Error(`${name} must be a valid object.`);
    }
}

module.exports = {
    validateObject
};
```

---

### File 2: `entities/Order.js`

This file contains the Node.js/JavaScript equivalent of the Java `Order` class.

```javascript
/**
 * @file Represents an Order entity, encapsulating details about a customer's rental transaction.
 * @module entities/Order
 */

// Import validation utilities
const { validateObject } = require('../utils/validation'); // Adjust path as necessary based on your project structure

/**
 * Represents a Customer entity.
 * @typedef {object} Customer
 * // In a real application, this would typically be a more detailed class or interface
 * // (e.g., `class Customer { id: number; name: string; ... }`).
 * // For the purpose of this conversion, we assume it's a plain object with relevant customer data.
 */

/**
 * Represents a Film entity.
 * @typedef {object} Film
 * // In a real application, this would typically be a more detailed class or interface
 * // (e.g., `class Film { id: number; title: string; ... }`).
 * // For the purpose of this conversion, we assume it's a plain object with relevant film data.
 */

/**
 * Represents a Rental entity.
 * @typedef {object} Rental
 * // In a real application, this would typically be a more detailed class or interface
 * // (e.g., `class Rental { id: number; rentalDate: Date; returnDate: Date; ... }`).
 * // For the purpose of this conversion, we assume it's a plain object with relevant rental data.
 */

/**
 * @class Order
 * @classdesc A Plain Old JavaScript Object (POJO) representing a customer's order for a film rental.
 *            This class is primarily designed for data encapsulation and transfer, mirroring a JavaBean.
 *            It adheres to Node.js best practices, including proper error handling and JSDoc comments.
 *

class Order {
    /**

     * This constructor is synchronous as it only initializes properties.
     *

     * @param {Film} film - The film being ordered. Must be a valid object.

        return this._film;
    }

    }

     *
     * @param {Rental} newRental - The new rental object. Must be a valid object.
     * @throws {Error} If the provided rental is not a valid object.
     */
    set rental(newRental) {
        validateObject(newRental, 'Rental');
        this._rental = newRental;
    }

    // --- Note on Asynchronous Operations (async/await) ---
    // The original Java class is a simple data encapsulation (POJO) and does not contain
    // any asynchronous operations. Therefore, introducing `async/await` into its direct
    // conversion would be inappropriate and misleading, as getters, setters, and constructors
    // for data-holding classes are inherently synchronous operations in JavaScript.
    //
    // If future functionality were added to this class that involved I/O (e.g., fetching
    // customer details from a database, saving the order to a persistent store, or
    // interacting with external APIs), then `async/await` would be the correct pattern
    // to use for those specific methods to handle promises gracefully. For example:
    //
    // ```javascript
    // async save() {
    //     try {
    //         // Simulate an asynchronous database save operation
    //         const result = await database.saveOrder(this._customer, this._film, this._rental);
    //         console.log('Order saved successfully:', result);
    //         return result;
    //     } catch (error) {
    //         console.error('Failed to save order:', error);
    //         throw new Error('Could not save order due to a database error.');
    //     }
    // }
    // ```
    // However, for the direct conversion of the provided Java POJO, no such asynchronous
    // operations are present or required.
}

module.exports = Order;
```
